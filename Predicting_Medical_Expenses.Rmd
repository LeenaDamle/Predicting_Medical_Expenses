## Building Multiple Linear Regression Model for Predicting Medical Expenses ----
## Step 2: Exploring and preparing the data ----
insurance <- read.csv("insurance.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
str(insurance)

# summarize the charges variable
summary(insurance$expenses)

```

##'expenses' is our dependent variable. Using linear regression, we will try to predict expenses using all other independent variables.
```{r}

# histogram of insurance charges
hist(insurance$expenses)
```

##From the histogram, we see that the distribution of insurance expenses is right-skewed.
```{r}

# table of region
table(insurance$region)

```

##The data is almost evenly distributed among the four regions.
##We now try to find the linear association between the features by calculating their correlation coefficients with each other in a correlation matrix:
```{r}

# exploring relationships among features: correlation matrix
cor(insurance[c("age", "bmi", "children", "expenses")])
```

```{r}
# visualing relationships among features: scatterplot matrix
pairs(insurance[c("age", "bmi", "children", "expenses")])
```

##There appears to be a somewhat linear relationship between 'age' and 'expenses'
```{r}
# more informative scatterplot matrix
library(psych)
pairs.panels(insurance[c("age", "bmi", "children", "expenses")])

```

##The correlation ellipse between bmi and children is almost a perfectly round oval. This indicates very weak correlation between them.
##The loess curve for age and children is an upside-down U, peaking around middle age. This is a non-linear relationship indicating that middle-aged people have the most number of children on the insuarance plan.
```{r}

## Step 3: Training a model on the data ----
ins_model <- lm(expenses ~ age + children + bmi + sex + smoker + region,
                data = insurance)
ins_model <- lm(expenses ~ ., data = insurance) # this is equivalent to above

# see the estimated beta coefficients
ins_model
```

##The beta coefficients for each feature indicate the estimated increase in expenses for an increase of one unit in the feature. eg. For every addition of a smoking individual, expenses increase by $23847.5
```{r}
## Step 4: Evaluating model performance ----
# see more detail about the estimated beta coefficients
summary(ins_model)
```

##Small and statistically significant p-values for age, bmi and smokeryes indicate that these features are extremely likely to have a relationship with the dependent variable.

##The multiple R-squared value of 0.7509 indicates that the model explains nearly 75 percent of the variation in the dependent variable.
```{r}
## Step 5: Improving model performance ----

#The relationship between age and expenses is not truely linear
# add a higher-order "age" term
insurance$age2 <- insurance$age^2

#BMI has an effect on the expenses only after a threshold value is reached. Hence we convert it to a binary indicator variable
# add an indicator for BMI >= 30
insurance$bmi30 <- ifelse(insurance$bmi >= 30, 1, 0)

#as high BMI and the presence of smoking combined together have a greater impact on expenses, we include them as an interaction BMI30*smoker
# create final model
ins_model2 <- lm(expenses ~ age + age2 + children + bmi + sex +
                   bmi30*smoker + region, data = insurance)

summary(ins_model2)
```

##The improved model has a multiple R-squared value of 0.8664 and adjusted R-squared value of 0.8653. It can now explain almost 86.6% of variations in the medical expenses.
